# Face Compare API
The Face Compare API is designed for comparing two facial images. It takes in two images and returns a comparison result, indicating whether the two faces belong to the same person, along with a score and threshold.

- **URL:** `/compare/`
- **Allowed method:** `POST`
- **Require authentication:** YES


## Request Headers
| Header Field | Required | Remarks                                  |
|--------------|----------|------------------------------------------|
| x-api-key    | Yes      | API key issued to you/your organization. |
| x-session-token | Yes, if we ask you to provide.  | Session token generated by /session/ endpoint. |

## Request Fields
The required fields for the POST request are listed as follows:

| Request Field Name      | Required | Type          | Remarks |
|-------------------------|----------|---------------|---------|
| `pic1` or `pic1_bytes`  | YES      | File or Bytes | You must provide one of these options, depending on your requirements. For `pic1`, we accept image files directly, while for `pic1_bytes`, we expect a **base64-encoded** image. Please refer to the example notebook and Postman for detailed use cases of this field.
| `pic2` or `pic2_bytes`  | YES      | File or Bytes | You must provide one of these options, depending on your requirements. For `pic2`, we accept image files directly, while for `pic2_bytes`, we expect a **base64-encoded** image. Please refer to the example notebook and Postman for detailed use cases of this field.
| `auto_rotate`  | NO      | Boolean | This field is not required. It defaults to `False`. However, in some cases, photos from KYC end users may not have proper EXIF information for the engine to determine the correct orientation of the image. You can enable this option in case some edge cases fail due to the face being in an incorrect orientation. This allows the engine to automatically try to rotate the image to the correct orientation for accurate comparison, but longer running time may incur for non-matching cases.

## Response Fields
The response fields for the request are listed as follows:

| Response Field Name | Type     | Remarks                                            |
|----------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `success`              | Boolean  | Whether the request is successfully finished.   |
| `result`               | JSON     | *Only for successful requests* The dictionary of comparison results, with detailed fields included in [this section](#face-compare-result-dictionary). |
| `error_message`        | String   | *Only for failed requests* Details of the encountered error. |
| `error_code`           | String   | *Only for failed requests* The error code for easier reference. Detailed matching can be found in [this section](#list-of-error-messages-and-error-codes). |

## Face Compare Result Dictionary

The result fields of a face comparison request are formatted as follows:

| Response Field Name | Type     | Remarks                                            |
|----------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `is_match`            | Boolean  | Indicates whether the two faces match, based on the threshold with an error rate of 0.01%. |
| `score`               | Float    | A score rounded to two decimal places in the range [0~100], describing how similar the two faces provided are. |
| `failed_stage` | Int | An indicator for the stage where it failed. You should refer to this when you ask the guest to upload a selfie holding their ID. There are three stages: <ol><li> The face does not match inside the ID+selfie image.</li><li> The face does not match on ID and selfie face. </li> <li> The face does not match on ID image and held ID. </li></ol> The `failed_stage` indicates which compare does the process fails at.|
<!-- | `one_e3`              | Float    | A threshold score rounded to two decimal places in the range [0~100], showing the minimum requirement of the score when the **False Acceptance Rate** is 0.1%. This bar is the lowest. |
| `one_e4`              | Float    | A threshold score rounded to two decimal places in the range [0~100], showing the minimum requirement of the score when the **False Acceptance Rate** is 0.01%. This bar is higher than one_e3, but lower than one_e4. |
| `one_e5`              | Float    | A threshold score rounded to two decimal places in the range [0~100], showing the minimum requirement of the score when the **False Acceptance Rate** is 0.001%. This bar is the highest. -->

Please note that now we won't return the thresholds for the comparison anymore. Please refer to `is_match` directly.

## List of Error Messages and Error Codes

The following is a comprehensive list of potential error codes returned by the engine, along with their respective error messages and explanations:
