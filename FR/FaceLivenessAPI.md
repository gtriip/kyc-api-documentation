# Liveness Check API
This API is designed to passively assess the liveness of a selfie captured by the KYC end user. It takes the selfie image as input and provides a result indicating whether the user is a genuine person or if the image is a printout or displayed on a screen.

- **URL:** `/liveness/`
- **Allowed method:** `POST`
- **Require authentication:** YES

## Liveness Check Result Dictionary
The result fields of a liveness check request are formatted as follows:

| Field Name | Type    | Remarks |
|------------|---------|---------|
| `liveness`   | Boolean | Indicates whether the face is considered to be from a live person, instead of [printed attack](https://paperswithcode.com/task/face-anti-spoofing#:~:text=Print%20attack%3A%20The%20attacker%20uses%20someone%E2%80%99s%20photo.%20The%20image%20is%20printed%20or%20displayed%20on%20a%20digital%20device.) or [replay attacks](https://paperswithcode.com/task/face-anti-spoofing#:~:text=Replay/video%20attack%3A%20A%20more%20sophisticated%20way%20to%20trick%20the%20system%2C%20which%20usually%20requires%20a%20looped%20video%20of%20a%20victim%E2%80%99s%20face.%20This%20approach%20ensures%20behaviour%20and%20facial%20movements%20to%20look%20more%20%E2%80%98natural%E2%80%99%20compared%20to%20holding%20someone%E2%80%99s%20photo).|
| `score`      | Float   | A value from 0 to 1, indicating how confident the system is for the result.

## List of Error Messages and Error Codes

The following is a comprehensive list of potential error codes returned by the engine, along with their respective error messages and explanations:

| Error Code | Error Message                                        | Remarks                                                    |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `001`        | API key is either missing or incorrect.            | Please check the provided API key.            |
| `061`        | Session key is not found, please try again. | Please check if you have included the correct session key in your request. |
| `062`        | Session key limit reached, please try restart. | The limit for the certain API access for this API key has reached. Please request for a new one if you wish to continue requesting this API endpoint. | 
| `002`        | Error reading image, please check the request format. | This error occurs when the image fails to be recognized in the expected format.|
| `003`        | Image file size is too large.                      | The engine has a 10MB limit for image files; ensure they do not exceed this size.|
| `004`        | Request is not in the correct format.              | This error indicates an issue with the request format or missing key fields.|
| `005`        | Server internal error, please try again.           | In the case of an internal server error, please contact us if the issue persists.|
| `007`        | Image resolution too low!                          | The uploaded image resolution is too low to pass. |
| `051`        | No face, or more than one face is detected in the selfie. | We strictly require there to be only one face in the selfie image, so we would know which face should we check liveness for. Please ask the KYC end user to take this image in a clean background with no other face in the image to avoid this error. If the image has no face inside, it should also result in a failed request.|
| `052`        | Face mask is detected, please remove the face mask and try again. | This is a KYC concern, as we do not wish to allow the KYC process to be done with a face mask on. So if a mask is detected, the request would fail with this error.

## Thresholds and Explanations

This API incorporates two key thresholds: one for the **face detector** and another for the **liveness detector**. These thresholds ensure accurate and reliable results during the face detection and liveness verification processes.

### Face Detector Threshold
- **Current Setting**: 0.75  
    - If the confidence score for the detected face is below **0.75**, the face detection will be rejected.
- **Recommended Setting from Model Side**: 0.60  
    - However, this lower threshold has caused issues during the comparison stage, as faces with reflection obstructions might pass. Sticking with a higher threshold is recommended to maintain accuracy and reliability.

### Liveness Detector Threshold
- **Current Setting**: 0.90  
    - If the confidence score for the detected face being real is below **0.90**, the face will be rejected and considered as not live.
- **Recommended Setting**: 0.95  
    - If the confidence score for the detected face being real is below **0.95**, the face will be rejected and considered as not live.
    - A higher threshold increases the likelihood of false rejections, presenting a stricter challenge for acceptance.

These thresholds are designed to maintain the integrity and security of the face detection and liveness verification processes.
